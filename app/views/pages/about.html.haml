  %h1 About GSOH

  %p
    %b GSOH: Great Sense of Home
    was commissioned by Leeds City Council Adult Social Care as part of the
    innovation pathway, run by #{link_to 'Dhyaan Design', 'http://dhyaandesign.com/'}
    and #{link_to 'Leeds Data Mill', 'http://leedsdatamill.org/'}.
    
  %p
    The technology is similar to a dating site - users build a profile of
    themselves and then they're matched against areas of the city that best match
    their profile. Maybe you'll find somewhere new to live!

  %h2 About the data

  %p
    Leeds-specific data, such as the locations of public wifi and
    the Neighbourhood Network Schemes, is provided by
    #{link_to 'Leeds Data Mill', 'http://leedsdatamill.org/'}.

  %p
    A lot of the more generic data is provided by
    #{link_to 'OpenStreetMap', 'https://www.openstreetmap.org/'}. This is an
    editable map of the world - kind of like the Wikipedia of maps.
    If you spot that something is missing or in the wrong location, you're
    invited to fix it yourself!

  %h2 About the code

  %p
    The code for GSOH was written by #{link_to 'Fish Percolator', 'https://fishpercolator.co.uk/'}
    and is open source, released under the MIT licence.
    #{link_to 'Find it on Github!', 'https://github.com/fishpercolator/gsoh'}
  
  %p
    If you're another local authority who would like to adapt this for your
    own city, get in touch: hello@fishpercolator.co.uk
