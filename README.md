# GSOH: Great Sense of Home

GSOH (Great Sense of Home) is like a dating site, but instead of finding your perfect partner, you're finding your perfect area of Leeds.

Sign up for an account, answer a few questions about what you'd like to see in your ideal neighbourhood and then see which parts of Leeds best fit your preferences.

Once you've found your matches, you can see why GSOH thinks they're a match on a map of all the facilities in that neighbourhood.

## Installation

GSOH is a standard Rails application and is configured to run on Docker or Heroku.
